🧠 What is Two-Way Data Binding?

It means:

When UI changes → state updates,

and when state changes → UI updates.

Basically, both are in sync.

Angular does this automatically ([(ngModel)]="value"),
but in React, we do it manually using useState.

⚙️ Example: Two-way Binding in React (Simulated)
import React, { useState } from "react";

function TwoWayBindingExample() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  // function to handle input change
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setName(e.target.value); // updates the state when user types
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "50px" }}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}          // state → UI
        onChange={handleChange} // UI → state
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <h2>Hello, {name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TwoWayBindingExample;

⚡ Explanation:

value={name} → binds state to input (UI always shows current state)

onChange={handleChange} → binds input to state (typing updates state)

Together → this gives you two-way behavior 💫

🧩 In Short:
Concept	Description
One-way binding	Data flows parent → child only (default React behavior)
Two-way binding (simulated)	You sync state & input manually with useState + onChange
💬 Real talk:

Two-way binding looks fancy, but in big apps it becomes messy fast.
That’s why React’s one-way data flow is actually cleaner and easier to debug.
